# Array and String

## [Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def mergeAlternately(word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
    merged = []
    i, j = 0, 0

    # Merge alternately as long as both strings have characters left
    while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):
        merged.append(word1[i])
        merged.append(word2[j])
        i += 1
        j += 1

    # Append any remaining characters from word1
    merged.append(word1[i:])

    # Append any remaining characters from word2
    merged.append(word2[j:])

    # Join the characters into a single string
    return ''.join(merged)
```

### Computational Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of word1 and m is the length of word2. We traverse both strings once.
- Space Complexity: O(n + m) for storing the merged string.

### Keywords and Hints
- "Alternating order" suggests a pattern of taking one character from each string in turn.
- "If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end" indicates we need to handle different length strings.
- The problem is asking for a specific pattern of merging that involves interleaving characters.

### Key insights
- We need to merge characters one by one from each string, starting with word1.
- After one of the strings is exhausted, we need to append all remaining characters from the other string.
- The order of merging is strictly defined: first from word1, then from word2, and so on.

### Solution Intuition
The intuition is to create a simple two-pointer approach where we take characters alternately from both strings until one is exhausted. After that, we append any remaining characters from the non-exhausted string. This ensures we follow the alternating pattern while correctly handling strings of different lengths.

### Solution explanation
1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, to track positions in word1 and word2 respectively.
2. While both pointers are within their respective string bounds:
   - Add the character from word1 at position i to the result.
   - Add the character from word2 at position j to the result.
   - Increment both pointers.
3. After the loop, one or both strings may be exhausted. Append any remaining characters from either string.
4. Return the merged string.

### Analogy
Think of this algorithm like a zipper merging traffic from two lanes into one. Cars (characters) from the first lane (word1) and second lane (word2) take turns entering the merged lane. If one lane has more cars than the other, after all the alternating merges are done, the remaining cars from the longer lane simply continue into the merged lane without interruption.

This zipper analogy is particularly apt because, like how the teeth of a zipper interlock alternately, we interlock characters from the two strings in an alternating pattern until one string runs out of characters. After that, just as a zipper would continue with teeth from only one side if the other side ended, our algorithm appends all remaining characters from the longer string.

## [Greatest Common Divisor Of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def gcdOfStrings(str1, str2):
    # Check if the strings can have a common divisor
    if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
        return ""

    # If they can have a GCD, it's length will be the GCD of their lengths
    from math import gcd
    gcd_length = gcd(len(str1), len(str2))

    # The GCD string is the prefix of length gcd_length
    return str1[:gcd_length]
```

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the total length of str1 and str2. String concatenation and comparison take O(n) time, and computing the GCD is O(log(min(len(str1), len(str2)))) using Euclidean algorithm.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the concatenated strings.

### Keywords and Hints
- "t divides s" suggests a mathematical divisibility relationship
- "largest string x such that x divides both" indicates we're looking for a "greatest common divisor" in string form
- The term "divides" hints at repetition patterns
- The problem is titled "Greatest Common Divisor Of Strings" which directly links to the mathematical concept of GCD

### Key insights
1. If two strings str1 and str2 have a common divisor string, then str1 + str2 = str2 + str1
2. If a common divisor exists, the length of the GCD string is the mathematical GCD of the lengths of the two strings
3. The GCD string is a prefix of both strings with length equal to the GCD of their lengths

### Solution Intuition
If a string X divides both str1 and str2, then str1 and str2 are both made up of repetitions of X. If this is the case, then concatenating them in either order should yield the same result. That's why checking str1 + str2 == str2 + str1 tells us whether a common divisor exists.

If a common divisor exists, then the length of the GCD string will be the GCD of the lengths of the two strings. This makes sense because if X divides str1 (of length n) and str2 (of length m), then n/length(X) and m/length(X) are both integers, meaning length(X) is a divisor of both n and m.

### Solution explanation
1. First, check if the strings can have a common divisor by verifying if str1 + str2 equals str2 + str1. If not, return an empty string.
2. If a common divisor exists, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of str1 and str2 using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. Extract the prefix of str1 with length equal to the GCD of the lengths - this is our answer.

The key observation is that if a string can be divided by another string, the larger string must be made up of repetitions of the smaller string. Therefore, the GCD of the string lengths gives us the length of the GCD string.

### Analogy
Think of the strings as bead necklaces. If both necklaces are made using the same pattern of beads repeated multiple times, then there is a common design (the divisor).

For example, if one necklace has "red-blue-red-blue-red-blue" and another has "red-blue", then "red-blue" is the pattern that divides both. Finding the GCD of strings is like finding the shortest repeating pattern that makes up both necklaces.

The concatenation check (str1 + str2 == str2 + str1) is like checking if arranging these necklaces end-to-end produces the same pattern regardless of which one you place first. If they don't match, then there can't be a common pattern.

## [Kids With The Greatest Number Of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies):
    # Find the maximum number of candies any kid has
    max_candies = max(candies)

    # Check for each kid if they would have the most candies after getting extraCandies
    result = []
    for candy in candies:
        if candy + extraCandies >= max_candies:
            result.append(True)
        else:
            result.append(False)

    return result
```

### Computational Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of kids (length of the candies array)
  - Finding the maximum value takes O(n)
  - Iterating through each kid to determine the result also takes O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the result array

### Keywords and Hints
- "greatest number of candies" - This suggests we need to compare quantities
- "multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies" - This tells us ties are allowed
- "boolean array result" - We need to output true/false for each kid
- "after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies" - We're assessing each kid with a hypothetical addition

These keywords hint that we need to find a maximum value and then check each kid against that maximum, which points to a simple linear approach.

### Key insights
1. A kid will have the greatest number of candies (or tied for greatest) if and only if their original candies plus the extra candies is greater than or equal to the current maximum.
2. We don't need to actually modify the original array - we just need to check if the hypothetical sum would be enough.
3. The maximum number of candies can be found in a single pass, and then each kid can be evaluated with a simple comparison.

### Solution Intuition
The intuition is straightforward: if we want to know whether giving extraCandies to a kid will make them have the most candies, we need to:
1. Know what the current maximum number of candies is
2. See if adding extraCandies to a kid's current amount would make them reach or exceed that maximum

If they can reach or exceed the maximum, then they would have the greatest number (or be tied for it), so the result is true. Otherwise, it's false.

### Solution explanation
The solution follows these steps:
1. Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has using the `max()` function
2. Iterate through each kid's candy count:
   - Calculate their potential total if given the extra candies
   - If this total is greater than or equal to the current maximum, the result is true
   - Otherwise, the result is false
3. Return the array of boolean results

This approach is optimal because it requires only two passes through the array and minimal extra space.

### Analogy
Imagine a classroom where each student has a stack of books on their desk. The student with the tallest stack is considered the "book leader." Now, the teacher has a pile of extra books and wants to know which students would become the "book leader" (or tied for it) if given all these extra books.

Instead of actually moving the books around, the teacher first identifies the current tallest stack (let's say it's 10 books high). Then, she goes to each student and mentally adds her extra books (let's say 3) to their current stack:
- Student A has 7 books → 7+3=10 books → Equal to the maximum (true)
- Student B has 5 books → 5+3=8 books → Less than the maximum (false)
- Student C has 9 books → 9+3=12 books → More than the maximum (true)

This is exactly what our algorithm does - find the current maximum, then check each potential new total against it.

## [Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n):
    if n == 0:
        return True

    length = len(flowerbed)
    count = 0

    for i in range(length):
        # Check if current position is empty
        if flowerbed[i] == 0:
            # Check if the left and right positions are also empty
            # For left position, if i is 0 or flowerbed[i-1] is 0
            # For right position, if i is length-1 or flowerbed[i+1] is 0
            is_left_empty = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0)
            is_right_empty = (i == length - 1) or (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)

            # If both adjacent plots are empty, we can plant a flower
            if is_left_empty and is_right_empty:
                flowerbed[i] = 1  # Plant a flower
                count += 1

                # If we've planted enough flowers, return True
                if count >= n:
                    return True

    # If we couldn't plant enough flowers, return False
    return count >= n
```

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the length of the flowerbed array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.

### Keywords and Hints
- "Flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots" indicates a constraint that guides the placement rule
- "0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty" defines the state representation
- "No two adjacent flowers" suggests we need to check surrounding plots before planting
- The problem is asking for a greedy approach, where we can place flowers as soon as we find valid positions

### Key insights
1. A position is available for planting if and only if it's currently empty and has no flowers in adjacent positions
2. The greedy approach works optimally because it's always best to plant as early as possible
3. Edge cases need special handling - the first and last plots only need to check one adjacency
4. Modifying the array while iterating simplifies tracking of the placement constraints

### Solution Intuition
The intuitive approach is to walk through the flowerbed from left to right, and whenever we find an empty plot that can accommodate a flower (has no adjacent flowers), plant it immediately. Since we want to maximize the number of flowers we can plant, and there's no advantage to skipping a valid position, this greedy approach will give us the optimal solution.

### Solution explanation
1. Handle the base case: if n is 0, we don't need to plant any flowers, so return true
2. Iterate through the flowerbed array:
   - For each position, check if it's empty (0)
   - If it's empty, check if both adjacent positions are also empty (consider edge cases for first and last elements)
   - If both adjacent positions are empty, plant a flower (set the position to 1)
   - Increment our flower counter
   - If we've planted n flowers, return true
3. If we finish the iteration and haven't planted enough flowers, return false

### Analogy
Imagine you're seating people in a long row of chairs at a movie theater during a pandemic. Each person needs to have empty seats to their left and right for social distancing. As the usher, you want to seat as many people as possible.

The most efficient way is to walk down the row from the first seat, and whenever you find a seat that has no people adjacent to it, you seat someone there. After seating someone, that position becomes occupied and affects where the next person can sit. The edge seats (first and last) only need to worry about one adjacent seat.

If by the end of your walk, you've managed to seat at least the number of people in your party, then everyone can watch the movie. Otherwise, your group cannot be accommodated in that row.

## [Reverse Vowels Of A String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def reverseVowels(s: str) -> str:
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    s_list = list(s)
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        while left < right and s_list[left].lower() not in vowels:
            left += 1
        while left < right and s_list[right].lower() not in vowels:
            right -= 1

        # Swap vowels
        s_list[left], s_list[right] = s_list[right], s_list[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return ''.join(s_list)
```

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once with our two pointers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) to store the characters in a list for manipulation, as strings are immutable in Python.

### Keywords and Hints
- "Reverse only all the vowels" - This suggests a selective reversal, not a full string reversal.
- "Vowels can appear in both lower and upper cases" - Case-insensitive vowel detection is needed.
- The problem is about rearranging specific characters within a string - this hints at a two-pointer approach.

### Key insights
1. We need to identify vowels in the string, regardless of their case.
2. Only the vowels need to be reversed, while consonants stay in place.
3. A two-pointer approach allows us to find vowels from both ends and swap them efficiently.

### Solution Intuition
The intuition is to use two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string and one from the end. We move these pointers toward each other, looking for vowels. When both pointers find vowels, we swap them and continue moving the pointers. This approach ensures that we only reverse the vowels while keeping all other characters in place.

### Solution explanation
1. Convert the string to a list for easy character swapping.
2. Initialize two pointers: `left` starting at the beginning and `right` starting at the end.
3. Move the `left` pointer forward until it finds a vowel.
4. Move the `right` pointer backward until it finds a vowel.
5. Swap the vowels found by both pointers.
6. Continue steps 3-5 until the pointers meet or cross each other.
7. Convert the list back to a string and return it.

### Analogy
Think of this algorithm as reorganizing a row of people where only people wearing red hats need to switch positions in reverse order, while everyone else stays in place.

Imagine a line of people where some wear red hats (representing vowels) and others wear blue hats (representing consonants). You have two ushers - one starting from the left end of the line and one from the right. The left usher walks right looking for red hats, while the right usher walks left also looking for red hats. When both ushers find people with red hats, they ask these two people to swap positions. The ushers continue until they meet in the middle. At the end, the people with blue hats are still in their original positions, but the people with red hats have reversed their order in the line.

## [Reverse Words In A String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def reverseWords(s: str) -> str:
    # Split the string into words, which also removes extra spaces
    words = s.split()

    # Reverse the list of words
    words.reverse()

    # Join the words with a single space
    return ' '.join(words)
```

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` operations all take O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store all the words in a new list and create a new output string.

### Keywords and Hints
- "reverse the order of the words" - This suggests we need to identify individual words first before reversing them.
- "separated by at least one space" - This indicates we need to handle variable numbers of spaces.
- "should only have a single space separating the words" - We need to normalize spaces between words.
- "Do not include any extra spaces" - This tells us to remove leading and trailing spaces.

These keywords suggest that string manipulation functions like `split()` that automatically handle spaces would be ideal.

### Key insights
1. The problem is about reversing the order of words, not characters.
2. We need to handle multiple spaces between words and remove leading/trailing spaces.
3. Python's `split()` without arguments already handles removing extra spaces and splits by whitespace.
4. After splitting, we can simply reverse the array of words and join them back with single spaces.

### Solution Intuition
The solution follows a straightforward approach:
1. Break the string into individual words, removing all extra spaces
2. Reverse the order of these words
3. Combine the words back into a single string with exactly one space between each word

This approach avoids manual handling of spaces and word boundaries.

### Solution explanation
1. `s.split()` splits the input string into a list of words, automatically removing leading, trailing, and multiple spaces.
2. `words.reverse()` reverses the order of words in the list.
3. `' '.join(words)` joins the words back together with exactly one space between each word.

This solution efficiently handles all the requirements: it reverses the order of words, removes extra spaces, and ensures only single spaces between words in the output.

### Analogy
Think of this problem like a bookshelf where each book represents a word, and the spaces between books represent spaces in the string.

1. First, we take all the books off the shelf, ignoring any unnecessary gaps between them (the `split()` operation).
2. Then, we rearrange the books in reverse order, taking the books from the right side and placing them on the left (the `reverse()` operation).
3. Finally, we put the books back on the shelf with exactly one standard-sized gap between each book (the `join()` operation).

This analogy captures how we transform the input by separating words, reversing their order, and ensuring standardized spacing.

## [Product Of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    answer = [1] * n

    # Calculate left products
    left_product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        answer[i] = left_product
        left_product *= nums[i]

    # Calculate right products and multiply with left products
    right_product = 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        answer[i] *= right_product
        right_product *= nums[i]

    return answer
```

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We do two passes through the array, each taking O(n) time
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Excluding the output array, we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables

### Keywords and Hints
- "Product of all elements **except** nums[i]" - Suggests we need to compute some kind of cumulative product
- "O(n) time" - Rules out naive O(n²) approach of computing product for each element separately
- "Without using the division operation" - This is critical - we can't just compute the total product and divide by each element
- "Prefix or suffix" - Hints that we should consider products from both directions

### Key insights
1. For each position i, the answer is the product of all elements to the left of i multiplied by the product of all elements to the right of i
2. We can compute left and right cumulative products in two separate passes through the array
3. By combining these two products, we get our answer without using division

### Solution Intuition
The problem asks for the product of all elements except the current one. If division were allowed, we could:
1. Calculate the product of all elements
2. For each index, divide the total product by the current element

But since we can't use division, we need another approach. The key insight is to break down what "product of all elements except self" really means:
- For each position, we need (product of all elements to the left) × (product of all elements to the right)

### Solution explanation
The algorithm uses a two-pass approach:

1. First pass (left to right):
   - For each position i, store the product of all elements to the left of i
   - Start with left_product = 1 (since there are no elements to the left of the first element)
   - For each element, store the current left_product, then update left_product by multiplying with the current element

2. Second pass (right to left):
   - Compute the product of all elements to the right
   - Start with right_product = 1
   - For each element, multiply the answer (which currently contains left products) by right_product
   - Update right_product by multiplying with the current element

This approach gives us the correct answer without using division and only requires O(n) time.

### Analogy
Imagine a line of people, each holding a number card. Their task is to figure out the product of everyone else's numbers without using division.

An efficient approach would be:
1. First, everyone looks to their left. The leftmost person writes "1" on a second card. The second person writes the first person's number on their second card. The third person writes the product of the first and second person's numbers, and so on.

2. Next, everyone looks to their right. Starting from the rightmost person, they multiply what's on their second card by the product of all numbers to their right. The rightmost person has no one to their right, so they multiply by 1.

By the end of this process, each person's second card contains the product of everyone else's numbers. This is exactly how our algorithm works - computing products from left and right independently, then combining them to get the final answer.

## [Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def increasingTriplet(nums):
    first = second = float('inf')

    for num in nums:
        if num <= first:
            first = num
        elif num <= second:
            second = num
        else:
            return True

    return False
```

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We scan through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only use two additional variables regardless of the input size.

### Keywords and Hints
- "triplet of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]" - This indicates we need to find a strictly increasing subsequence of length 3.
- "Follow up: O(n) time and O(1) space" - This is a strong hint that we shouldn't use sorting or additional data structures like stacks/queues.
- "If no such indices exists" - We need to be prepared for cases where no triplet exists.
- The focus on indices order (i < j < k) suggests we need to maintain the original order while scanning.

### Key insights
- We don't need to track the actual indices, only the values.
- We can keep track of the smallest and second smallest elements we've seen so far.
- If we find a number larger than both, we have our increasing triplet.
- Importantly, when updating `first` and `second`, we maintain the invariant that if a triplet exists, our algorithm will find it.

### Solution Intuition
The key intuition is to maintain two variables:
1. `first`: the smallest number seen so far
2. `second`: the smallest number seen so far that is greater than `first`

If we encounter a number larger than both `first` and `second`, we've found our triplet. The tricky part is understanding that even when we update `first`, we don't need to reset `second` because if we later find a number larger than both the current `first` and `second`, then we've found our triplet.

### Solution explanation
1. Initialize `first` and `second` to infinity.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If the current number is less than or equal to `first`, update `first` (we found a smaller first element).
   - If the current number is greater than `first` but less than or equal to `second`, update `second` (we found a better second element).
   - If the current number is greater than both `first` and `second`, we've found our triplet, return `True`.
3. If we've gone through the entire array without finding a triplet, return `False`.

The algorithm works because it guarantees that if there exists an increasing triplet, we'll either capture it directly or establish values for `first` and `second` that will allow us to identify the third element later in the traversal.

### Analogy
Imagine you're climbing a mountain range and looking for three successively higher viewpoints.

- `first` represents the lowest viewpoint you've found so far.
- `second` represents the lowest viewpoint you've found that's higher than `first`.
- If you find a viewpoint higher than `second`, you've successfully found your three viewpoints with increasing height.

As you explore the range, you might discover an even lower starting point. In that case, you update `first`, but you keep `second` as is because you've already found a viewpoint higher than your previous starting point. If you later find a viewpoint higher than both your new `first` and your existing `second`, you still have your three increasing viewpoints (even though the first viewpoint in your triplet might not be the one you originally designated as `first`).

This analogy works because, like the algorithm, you're continuously updating your "best candidates" for the first two viewpoints while searching for the third, higher one.

## [String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

*Claude 3.7 Sonnet:*

### Code solution
```python
def compress(chars):
    if not chars:
        return 0

    write_pos = 0  # Position to write characters to
    read_pos = 0   # Position to read characters from

    while read_pos < len(chars):
        current_char = chars[read_pos]
        count = 0

        # Count consecutive occurrences of the current character
        while read_pos < len(chars) and chars[read_pos] == current_char:
            read_pos += 1
            count += 1

        # Write the character
        chars[write_pos] = current_char
        write_pos += 1

        # Write the count if greater than 1
        if count > 1:
            # Convert count to string and write each digit
            count_str = str(count)
            for digit in count_str:

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The problem requires us to modify the input array in-place.

### Keywords and Hints
- **"Compress"**: Indicates we need to reduce the size of the array by grouping consecutive identical characters.
- **"In-place modification"**: We need to modify the original array, not create a new one.
- **"Constant extra space"**: This suggests using two-pointer technique to modify the array in-place.
- **"Group's length"**: We need to count consecutive repeating characters.
- **"10 or longer will be split"**: This means we need to handle multi-digit counts by writing each digit individually.

### Key insights
1. The problem can be solved with a two-pointer approach - one for reading and one for writing.
2. We need to count consecutive characters and then write the compressed representation.
3. For counts greater than 1, we need to store each digit separately in the array.
4. The return value is the new length of the compressed array, not the array itself.

### Solution Intuition
The intuition is to read through the array once, keeping track of consecutive identical characters. When we encounter a new character or reach the end, we write the current character and its count (if greater than 1) to the earlier positions in the array. Since the compressed array will always be shorter than or equal to the original array, we can safely overwrite the original array.

### Solution explanation
1. Use two pointers: `read_pos` to traverse the original array and `write_pos` to update the array in-place.
2. For each character, count how many consecutive occurrences it has by advancing `read_pos` until a different character is found.
3. Write the character at the `write_pos` position and increment `write_pos`.
4. If the count is greater than 1, convert it to a string and write each digit to the array, incrementing `write_pos` after each digit.
5. Continue until all characters have been processed.
6. Return `write_pos`, which represents the new length of the compressed array.

### Analogy
Think of this algorithm as a mail sorting process. You have a long line of letters (the characters) to be sent, and many of them are duplicates going to the same address.

A mail sorter (the algorithm) walks down the line (read_pos) and groups identical consecutive letters. Instead of keeping all duplicates, the sorter replaces each group with just one letter plus a number tag indicating how many were in the group.

The sorter then places this compressed representation back in the line (at write_pos), moving forward to place the next compressed group. Since the compressed representation is always shorter or equal to the original group, there's always enough space.

At the end, the sorter reports how many items remain in the line after compression (the return value). This is just like our algorithm that traverses the array once, compresses consecutive identical characters, and modifies the array in-place to store the compressed version.
